How to access the logs of my bots and other nebixbm logs?


1. Get the path for your log files by calling "nebixbm --show-logs-dir" or
    in short: "nebixbm -shld"


2. Copy the output path and use cd to change your directory:
    "cd <log files path>"


3. Use ls command to check the directory and find the log file you are
    looking for
    e.g. "ls -l" to list the contents of the directory
