How to schedule a function(method) to be called periodically or at a certain
date and time?


By installing nebixbm, you will also install a requirement module
named "schedule". (Read more: https://schedule.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
schedule as its documentation suggests is:
"An in-process scheduler for periodic jobs that uses the builder pattern for
configuration. Schedule lets you run Python functions (or any other callable)
periodically at pre-determined intervals using a simple, human-friendly syntax"

So, by using schedule you will be able to write scheduled functions. And there
is also a good bot sample to demonstrate the usage of schedule module in
a bot which you can check out at:
"nebixbm/command_center/bot/scheduled_bot"
