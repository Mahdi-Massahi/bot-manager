How to add a new strategy to nebixbot?


1. Create a folder in "nebixbot/command_center/strategy/" with given arbitrary
    name (your strategy name in snake_case style: use lowercase letters and
    underline) e.g. "/sample_strategy/"


2. Create a python file having the same name as your folder
    e.g. "/sample_strategy/sample_strategy.py"


3. Create an empty init file ("__init__.py") in the same directory as your
    strategy python file
    (Now your strategy folder includes both "sample_strategy.py" and
    "__init__.py" files)

4. Add your codes in your strategy python file (sample_strategy.py) as
    it is described in Template Strategy located in:
    "nebixbot/command_center/strategy/template_strategy/template_strategy.py"
    You can also take a look at other sample strategies available in strategy
    folder to get more ideas

5. Register your strategy in "available_strategies.py" file located at:
    "nebixbot/command_center/strategy/available_strategies.py"


6. Reinstall and rerun nebixbot (check README.md)


7. Check if your new strategy exists strategy list: "nebixbot -sh"
