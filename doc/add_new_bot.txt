How to add a new bot to nebixbm?

1. Create a folder in "nebixbm/command_center/bot/" with given arbitrary
    name (your bot name in snake_case style: use lowercase letters and
    underline) e.g. "/sample_bot/"
2. Create a python file having the same name as your folder
    e.g. "/sample_bot/sample_bot.py"
3. Create an empty init file ("__init__.py") in the same directory as your
    bot python file
    (Now your bot folder includes both "sample_bot.py" and
    "__init__.py" files)
4. Add your codes in your bot python file (sample_bot.py) as
    it is described in Template Bot located in:
    "nebixbm/command_center/bot/template_bot/template_bot.py"
    You can also take a look at other sample bots available in bot
    folder to get more ideas

    "nebixbm/command_center/bot/available_bots.py"
