Is it possible to pipe nebixbm output to other Unix/Linux commands? If yes,
how?

It is possible to pipe nebixbm as it is designed to
be piped if asked, as it will reduce the output to the important data and omit
the unnecessary. By using the "--only-output" optional argument you will get
the pure nebixbm response without any sugar-coatings.

e.g. you might want to change your current directory to the log files path.
First you need to get the log files directory by running "nebixbm -shld" and
then copying the path and using it with cd command: cd <log files path>
But by piping nebixbm you will achieve the same result by only one command
which is: "cd $(nebixbm -shld -oo)"
In the above scenario since cd does not accept any input, we used bash tricks
to give cd the nebixbm output. In a case in which STDIN is involved we can
easily pipe the result to the desired command:
e.g "nebixbm -oo <command(s)> | grep "foo"
