`ACCOUNT_BALANCE` is in terms of `BASE_CURRENCY`  

## `BASE_CURRENCY`
Is the currency that an accounts profit and loss is calculated and paid in or deposited or withdrawn.  

## `TRADING_ACCOUNT_BYBIT`
Refers to each `CONTRACT_BYBIT` that is separately calculated across Bybitâ€™s platform. 
Ex: `BTCUSD` contract is a contract that is settled and profit and loss is paid in `BTC` coin. So the `BASE_CURRENCY` of that `TRADING_ACCOUNT_BYBIT` is `BTC`.  

## `ZERO_EXPOSED_BALANCE_BYBIT`
Is the amount of `BASE_CURRENCY` in `TRADING_ACCOUNT_BYBIT` when there is no `OPEN_POSITION`.
In other words it is the same as `ACCOUNT_BALANCE` but in the situations that there is not open position.

## `CONTRACT_BYBIT`
Is a futures contract whether linear or inverse or inverse futures. Every contracts has its own definition and they should be referred to Bybit's own website and it is prone to change overtime.  

## `OPEN_POSITION_BYBIT`
The same definition as described in the contract detail.

## `TRADING_BALANCE_BYBIT`
Is the `ZERO_EXPOSED_BALANCE_BYBIT` minus `WITHDRAW_AMOUNT`.  

## `DEPOSIT_AMOUNT_BYBIT`
The amount of money in terms of `BASE_CURRENCY` in which is deposited or exchanged through `MOTHER_ACCOUNT_BYBIT` (that effects `ACCOUNT_BALANCE` and `ZERO_EXPOSED_BALANCE_BYBIT`)  

## `MOTHER_ACCOUNT_BYBIT`
Is the account of Bybit that is associated with an email address. It encompasses multiple coins and multiple contracts to trade and coin exchange options.

## `PNL`
Profit and loss that is calculated after any trade or between two points in time. Its unit is in `BASE_CURRENCY`.  

## `PNLP`
